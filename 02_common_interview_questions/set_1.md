JavaScript is a single-threaded language. This means it has one call stack and one memory heap. As expected, it executes code in order and must finish executing a piece code before moving onto the next. This is what allows JavaScript to be non-blocking and use async operations.
However, Javascript also has asynchronous behavior. This is what allows us to use setTimeout, AJAX, and promises. These functions are handled by the browser, not by JavaScript itself. This is what allows JavaScript to be non-blocking for main thread operations.

  Default value of let is uninitialized.
- const: The scope of a variable defined with the keyword “const” is limited to the block defined by curly braces. However if a variable is defined with keyword const, it cannot be reassigned.

There are mainly two types of data types in JavaScript: primitive data types and object (reference) data types.

Primitive data types are the basic data types in JavaScript. They include numbers, strings, booleans, null, and undefined. Symbols are also primitive data types, that represent unique identifiers.

Object data types are data types that contain other data types. They are created using object literals or constructor functions. Objects, Arrays, and Functions are examples of object data types.
